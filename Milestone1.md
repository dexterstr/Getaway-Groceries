# Getaway-Groceries
## Milestone 1
## Project Description:
We were approached by a client who wants us to create a eCommerce Website that is an Online Grocery Store selling fruits and vegetables either fresh or preserved, meat, seafood, dairy products, pantry, beauty and body care products, household items etc. Customers can place orders online and can get next-day deliveries.  Then main aim of our website is allowing a customer to find their product(s), add them to their "cart" and securely enter their payment information to complete the purchase.

## Team meetings:
We will have meetings mostly on the Zoom for discussing our status of the work. We will also maintain a track for the issues we face and try to resolve them by discussing with teammates and also discuss the next part of work and follow the instructions.

## Contacting each other:
We will be communicating using Northwest Email and Zoom to setup online meetings for sharing our progress of work.
## Dealing with a non-participating team member:
A non-participating group member may show that something is off with the group. Maybe the team's approach isn't working or the mission isn't clear. Return to the group's shared vision and mission and clarify best strategies for satisfying them. To advance way better cohesion, ask the individual out for coffee or lunch and attempt to get to know him or her better, and bring a couple of other colleagues along.
