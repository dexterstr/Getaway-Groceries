1.	<b>Stakeholder communications requirements:</b>

The reason of Communication Administration is to characterize the communication necessities for the project and how information will be conveyed. It mainly defines what information will be communicated, how the information is communicated, to whom and when the information is communicated and an escalation process for resolving any communication based conflicts. There are three general classes of communication that are required in an effective stakeholder administration; reporting, public relations (showcasing) and purposeful communication. Reporting, PR and promoting and purposeful communication.<br>

## Risk Management Plan
<b>Prepared By:</b> Navya Devineni					<b>Date:</b> 5/28/2020
 
1. <b>Methodology: </b>
Prior to dealing with the project to the customer, we should check the issues and we have to determine the issues with no obstructions. 

2. <b>Roles and responsibilities: </b>
If there is any problem in the project, first we should discover who is liable for these issues, for that the risk manager takes the charge and assess the project. Risk team is liable for settling any risk happened during any phase of the project. 

3. <b>Budget and schedule: </b>
There is always risk to cost the projects. To decrease the risk, we execute risk management plan. Risk management team keeps tracks of budget and evaluate the risks. 

4. <b>Risk categories: </b>
In a project, there are various categories of risk included, for example, people risk, technical risk, financial risk, and market risk, structure/process risk. 

5. <b>Risk probabilities and impact:</b> 
Risk can be estimated in number of clients, capital, Human Resource, utilization of the website. Risk may happen from numerous points of view. An example model 'A slip in budget' is a case of budgetary division assets. 

6. <b>Revised stakeholders’ tolerance: </b>
Stakeholders risk resistances are the proportions of the level of vulnerability that a Stakeholder acknowledges in regard of the project risk evaluation and they are overhauled during risk management planning. 

7. <b>Tracking: </b>
Each issue happened during the project phase is logged into the issue log. It is tracked until the defect is solved. Week by week surveys help in monitoring the risks making the administration simple to deal with. We ensure that the defects emerge in cycle 1 are not rehashed in cycle 2 by appropriate tracking of the issues. 

8. <b>Risk documentation:</b>
Documentations are put away in cloud drive and they are refreshed regularly when they are required. Soft copies are useful for simple updating. Prior to going to the meetings, printed copies are kept up.
I.	<b>Risk Register</b>
Risk register included in the excel worksheet which is attached in the file.
II.	<b>Risk mitigation strategies</b>

<b>Introduction:</b>

The quality administration depicts a lot of arranged activities to guarantee that the item and administrations agree to indicate prerequisites. It includes checking the last nature of the item and administrations to stay away from absconds. Undertaking the board procedures ought to be properly followed Procedures of value the board

•	Planning quality management is done during planning process
•	Performing quality assurance is done during execution process
•	Performing quality control is done as a part of monitoring and control


<b>Quality Standards</b><br>
Quality measures are characterized as reports that give necessities, details, rules, or attributes that can be utilized reliably to guarantee that materials, items, procedures, and administrations are fit for their motivation.
Standards give associations the common vision, getting, strategies, and jargon expected to meet the desires for their partners. Since norms present exact portrayals and phrasing, they offer a target and legitimate reason for associations and shoppers around the globe to convey and lead business.
The following are the standards that to maintained:
1. Must maintain Risk Management standards.
2. Information security and records management should be maintained.
International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
•	“Totality of characteristics of an entity that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs” (ISO8042:1994)
•	“The degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements” (ISO9000:2000)
•	ISO 9001:2015 is the most recognized and implemented quality management system standard in the world.

<b>Metrics</b>
Attributes like size, unpredictability, structure highlights, execution, and quality level are utilized to improve the advancement upkeep exercises of the product. Metric is a standard of estimation of the quality. 

All the deformities during Unit Testing, Integration testing and System Testing must be recorded. An assistance level understanding (SLA) characterizes the degree of administration expected by a client from a provider.

Below Points are needed to be captured as a part of metrics
•	The amount of time the service is available for use. 
•	Counts or percentages of errors in major deliverables or during testing.
•	Technical quality such as, measurement of technical quality by commercial analysis tools that examine factors such as program size and coding defects.
1.	Unit Testing: A Unit is a smallest testable portion of application. This kind of testing helps to test each module separately.
2.	Integration Testing: It means combining different modules occurs between unit and system testing and checks the data flow.
3.	System Testing: It is the final test to verify the system meets all the specification.
4.	Acceptance Testing: It is basically done by the end user. However, other stockholders can be involved in this process.
We use below metrics to measure quality:

•	Requirements Coverage = 100 %
•	Lines coverage Percentage = 80 %
•	Methods coverage Percentage = 75%
•	Conditional Covergae Percentage = 75%
•	Executed test cases percentage = 100%
•	Acceptance defects= 0 High defects, 2 Medium defects, 5 low defects

<b>Problem Reporting and Corrective Action Process:</b>

What to Do :
•	Assign the actual resources for the project by identifying the quality control and quality assurance roles and responsibilities
•	To support quality for the project, identify any quality related tools are required.
•	Define the quality control and quality assurance problem reporting plan and quality assurance problem.

How to do it:
•	The actual resources were assigned in the staffing plan management and quality roles and responsibilities were identified in the project charter.
•	Identify the tools and purpose of which you will be using them.
           Example: Version control tool
•	A plan to be describe to document, categorize and track to closure items reported through the quality assurance activities and quality control.

Supplier Quality and Control:
Quality control monitors project deliverables to verify that the deliverables are of acceptable quality and the customer is satisfied.
•	The application performance should be high.
•	It must have user friendly interface.
•	The application must have no or less buffering time.
•	Technical support availability and support in developing and optimizing processes
•	Basic tools that help in performing quality control.
For example: Cause-and-effect diagrams, Control chart, Check sheet, Scatter diagram, Histogram etc.
